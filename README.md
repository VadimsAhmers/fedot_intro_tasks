## Core features

1. **FEDOT Framework Integration**: The project demonstrates the use of the FEDOT (Federated Optimization and Deep learning) framework for automated machine learning tasks, specifically on Kaggle competitions.
2. **Automated Pipeline Composition**: The core functionality involves automatically composing machine learning pipelines using FEDOT's composition algorithms (Random Search and Genetic Programming).
3. **Pipeline Tuning**: The project includes pipeline tuning using techniques like SimultaneousTuner to optimize the performance of generated pipelines.
4. **Performance Evaluation**: The project evaluates pipeline performance using metrics like ROC AUC (for classification) and R-squared (for regression).
